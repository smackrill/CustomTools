Custom Tools for Work


This section includes samples of the tools I work with.  A lot of which I cannot claim original authoriship on- as there have been collaborative efforts of my colleagues in some of these tools as well as my own.  All are tools in which I have edited for my purposes in some way.

I owe credit to my colleague Ralph N.  For assisting me greatly in learning how to create and use these tools.
